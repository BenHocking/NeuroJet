Overview
========

The goal of the NeuroJet project is a technology suitable for studying the biological basis of cognition. The software helps neuroscientists produce quantitative predictions at a variety of levels;
from the firing patterns of individual neurons to the cognition and behavior of individual organisms. NeuroJet is a neural network simulator initially designed for simulations of the mammalian
hippocampus.
